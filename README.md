To use the liveries included in this repository:
- Copy all files found in the 'Files' folder found inside 'F-14_livery_pack'.
- Paste the files inside the 'Liveries' folder found under the path 'f-14b/Models'.
  The path to that folder may differ depending on the way you've added the F-14 to
  the launcher. 
  For instance, if the 'f-14b' folder is found under the path
  'fg-aircraft(-[branch])/aircraft' (where [branch] is any of the branches available
  in the F-14 GitHub repository found at https://github.com/Zaretto/fg-aircraft)
  and the 'fg-aircraft(-[branch])' folder is located on your
  desktop, the path would probably be:
  'Desktop/fg-aircraft(-[branch])/aircraft/f-14b/Models/Liveries'.
		  
I really hope you enjoy my work as much as I do. Happy flying!
